# workflow_demo
This repository is intended to use as a demo about how I organize my research projects: from data to manuscript.

This repository has the following file folders:

- `Data`: this folder is used to hold raw data and output data.
- `R`: this folder holds all R codes.
- `Doc`: this folder holds manuscripts.
